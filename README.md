## Cookbook

### Include image in template

In file pug/includes/require.pug located function, usage:

```pug
img(src='upload/sample.jpg' srcset=`upload/sample@2x.jpg 2x` alt='')
.block(style='background-image: url(upload/sample.jpg);')
```

For short include in file pug/mixins/img.pug located mixin, usage:

```pug
+img('sample.jpg')(alt='image').some-class
```

Attention! This mixin requires a picture in a double size (for srcset) and the link is already included `upload/` directory.

### Include plugins/libraries

#### CSS

Install dependency (for example, swiper):

```
yarn add swiper
```

Import dependency in main.styl once:

```
@import '~swiper/dist/css/swiper.css'
```

Symbol `~` in points to a node_modules folder.

#### JS

##### jQuery plugins

Install dependency (for example, sticky-kit):

```
yarn add sticky-kit
```

Import dependency in main.js once:

```js
import 'sticky-kit/dist/sticky-kit';
```

##### Other libraries

Install dependency (for example, swiper):

```
yarn add swiper
```

Import in the file in which you need the dependency:

```js
import Swiper from 'swiper/dist/js/swiper';
```

### Alias @ in scss and js

@ in path points to src folder, with it you can create an absolute path.
CSS:

```
src: url("~@/font/rouble-webfont.woff") format("woff")
```

JS:

```
import module from '@/js/module';
```

### Using svg-sprite

Put the icon in `/ico` folder

And add code in your template:

```html
<svg class="your-class" width="193" height="40">
  <use xlink:href="#your-icon-file-name"></use>
</svg>
```

Or you can use pug-mixin:

```pug
+icon('your-icon-file-name')(width=193 height=40).your-class
```
